In this section, we'll need the following:

- Raspberry Pi
- microSD Card
- Power Supply

## Prep Your Card

## Boot up and log in to Your Pi

### 2. Insert microSD Card

Take your SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi. You'll find the SD card slide on the bottom of the board, opposite the ethernet ports.

Plug the power supply into the device and let it boot up.

### 3. Terminal

On a Mac, open Spotlight search by pressing CMD + Space. Enter "Terminal" and select the application with the same name. 

Enter `ssh hush@hushline.local`, and when prompted, enter the password you created in the first step.
