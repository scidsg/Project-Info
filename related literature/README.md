## M-16-21: Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software, Office of Management & Budget, Executive Office of the President, August 8, 2016.

M-16-21, titled "Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software," is a memorandum issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the Executive Office of the President on August 8, 2016. This policy represents a significant step towards encouraging the use of open source software (OSS) within the federal government, with the aim of improving efficiency, increasing transparency, and fostering innovation in federal IT projects.

The key components and directives of the Federal Source Code Policy include:

1. Promotion of Open Source Software Use: The policy encourages federal agencies to actively consider and use open source software solutions where appropriate, as part of their broader IT investment strategies. This approach is intended to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and enable rapid innovation.
2. Requirement for New Custom-Developed Federal Software to be Open Source: One of the most notable aspects of the policy is the requirement that new custom-developed software intended for federal use be made available as open source software, thereby allowing other agencies and the public to benefit from government-funded development.
3. Launch of the Federal Source Code Catalog: The memorandum mandates the creation of a centralized inventory of the government's custom-developed software. This catalog aims to promote reuse of existing solutions within the government, reducing unnecessary duplication of software development efforts.
4. Pilot Program for Open Source Software Sharing: M-16-21 introduced a pilot program requiring federal agencies to release at least 20% of their newly developed custom software as open source for three years. The goal of this pilot program is to contribute back to the wider community and encourage collaboration and shared development efforts.
5. Implementation of an Open Source Licensing Framework: Agencies are directed to attach appropriate open source licenses to the software they release, facilitating its reuse and collaboration with the broader software development community.
6. Enhanced Software Inventory Management: Federal agencies are required to maintain inventories of their software to identify reusable and open source software components, promoting transparency and effective management of software resources.
7. Improving Government Code Quality: By sharing source code publicly, the policy aims to improve the quality of government software through community review and contributions, leading to more secure and efficient software solutions.

The Federal Source Code Policy reflects a modern approach to software development and procurement within the federal government, emphasizing the benefits of openness, collaboration, and shared innovation. By leveraging open source software and encouraging the sharing of custom-developed source code, the policy aims to accelerate the development of high-quality, efficient, and reusable software solutions across federal agencies, ultimately benefiting the public through enhanced digital services and transparency.

## National Defense Authorization Act 2015 (FlTARA) (Title VIII, Subtitle D. H.R. 3979)

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015, which includes the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) within it, is a comprehensive piece of legislation that outlines the budget, expenditures, and policies for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). FITARA, specifically, is a crucial part of this act, focusing on reforming the management and acquisition of information technology (IT) across the federal government. It is included in Title VIII, Subtitle D of H.R. 3979.

FITARA was enacted to improve the way federal agencies acquire, implement, and manage their IT systems and services. Key aspects of FITARA include:

1. Enhanced Authority of Agency CIOs: FITARA significantly increases the authority of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) within federal agencies, giving them more control over the IT budget, governance, and personnel decisions related to IT services and projects.
2. Improved Transparency and Risk Management: The act requires federal agencies to report on IT investments and make this information publicly available on the IT Dashboard. It aims to improve transparency, oversight, and reduce duplication of IT investments.
3. Portfolio Review: FITARA mandates regular reviews of IT investment portfolios by agency CIOs to ensure they align with agency and federal policies and objectives. This process helps in identifying underperforming projects and areas where cost savings can be achieved.
4. Enhanced Acquisition Processes: The act calls for the improvement of the acquisition process for IT services and products, including the use of IT acquisition cadres and increased training for IT acquisition personnel.
5. Consolidation of Data Centers: FITARA continues the efforts of the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI), aiming to reduce the number of federal data centers and increase efficiency.
6. Benchmarking and Best Practices: The legislation encourages the use of government and industry best practices in IT acquisition and management, and it requires agencies to benchmark their IT and management processes against other federal agencies and the private sector.

By implementing these reforms, FITARA aims to reduce waste and inefficiency in federal IT spending, enhance the security and efficiency of government IT systems, and improve the delivery of digital services to the public. Since its enactment, FITARA has been a driving force behind significant changes in how federal agencies manage their IT resources, leading to cost savings and more streamlined operations.

## Clinger Cohen Act 1996, (USC Title 40 Chapter 113 11301-11303.)

The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, previously known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), is a federal law designed to improve the way the U.S. federal government acquires, uses, and manages information technology (IT). It was enacted to address the inefficiencies, waste, and lack of coordination in federal IT investments that were prevalent at the time. The act is codified in Title 40, United States Code, Chapters 113, sections 11301 to 11303.

Key provisions and objectives of the Clinger-Cohen Act include:

1. Establishment of Chief Information Officer (CIO) Positions: One of the significant provisions of the act was the creation of CIO positions within each federal agency. These CIOs are responsible for overseeing IT management practices, enhancing IT project oversight, and ensuring that IT investments align with an agency's missions and business needs.
2. Framework for IT Management: The act provided a comprehensive framework for the management of federal IT resources, aiming to ensure that IT projects are implemented on time, within budget, and deliver the expected benefits to stakeholders.
3. Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC): Clinger-Cohen Act introduced the CPIC process, requiring agencies to adopt a disciplined approach to IT investment management. This process involves selecting, managing, and evaluating IT investments to ensure they meet strategic goals and deliver value.
4. Performance-Based and Results-Based Management: The act emphasizes the importance of performance-based management of IT resources, encouraging agencies to focus on outcomes and results rather than inputs. It mandates the use of performance measures to assess the effectiveness of IT investments.
5. Promotion of Modular Contracting: Clinger-Cohen advocates for modular contracting for IT projects, recommending the breakdown of large projects into smaller, more manageable parts to reduce risk and improve project outcomes.
6. Enhanced Focus on IT Acquisition and Procurement: The act seeks to improve the federal government's ability to acquire IT systems and services by promoting the use of commercial off-the-shelf technology and encouraging competition.
7. Encouragement of Interoperability and Standardization: It promotes the use of interoperable systems and standards to facilitate information sharing and integration across different government agencies.

The Clinger-Cohen Act represented a significant shift in how the federal government viewed and managed its IT resources. By emphasizing the strategic role of IT in achieving agency missions, promoting efficient and effective management practices, and enhancing the oversight of IT investments, the act aimed to create a more modern, responsive, and efficient government. It laid the groundwork for subsequent IT reform initiatives and continues to influence federal IT management practices.
