# Hush Line: A new whistleblowing platform for organizations and individuals
## _Science & Design, Inc. launches the first platform for responsible disclosure that is open-source and non-profit managed._

**Las Vegas, NV, Aug 8, 2024** â€“ Today, Science & Design, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization based in California, US, is excited to announce the launch of Hush Line, the first open-source managed whistleblowing platform designed for journalists, business leaders, and educators! Hush Line provides an easy-to-use, secure, and private way for anyone to receive confidential information from their communities.

## Key Features of Hush Line

- **Verified Accounts:** Journalists, public figures, business leaders, and others can verify their accounts to help ensure people are talking to the right person.
- **End-to-end Encryption:** E2EE supported with OpenPGP.js.
- **Tor-Ready:** Hush Line deploys to a clear web address and an Onion Service for users with advanced privacy needs.
- **Opt-In User Directory:** Find who you need without hunting. Search through a directory of individuals who have opted in to be listed.
- **Mailvelope Integration:** Read encrypted messages directly in the browser.
- **Personal Server:** Custom-designed hardware that runs a Tor-only copy of the Hush Line for people who need to control their infrastructure.

Fear of retaliation is why people stay silent when they witness something wrong in the workplace. More than 60% of workers will witness harassment or discrimination in the office, yet only 15% will ever make a formal written complaint, and fewer than 1% will find a legal resolution. When someone does decide to come forward, it can be one of the riskiest things they can do, leading to significant personal and professional hardship; our goal is to help guide people to the path of greatest success. We connect whistleblowers to lawyers, former whistleblowers, business leaders, and more, and hope to be a source of clarity in the first steps taken in the whistleblowing journey.
