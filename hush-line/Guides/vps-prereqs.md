# VPS Prerequisites 

In this section you'll need the following things to get Hush Line ready to install:

1. Debit or credit card
2. Digital Ocean, or any other VPS provider

## Digital Ocean

Digital Ocean is an infrastructure service provider that provides a cost-effective way to create your first virtual private server (VPS).

### 1. Create an Account

Go to [digitalocean.com](digitalocean.com) and create an account. You'll need to enter payment information before you can create a VPS.

### 2. Create a VPS

Digital Ocean calls their VPS option Droplets. To create a droplet click the green "Create" button at the top of the screen, the click "Droplet."

You can configure your server to your desired specifications, but for this guide, we'll choose the following options:

- Location: San Francisco
- Image: Debian 12
- Size: Basic
- CPU: Regular SSD @ $4/mo

Create a strong password, then click "Create Droplet."

After a minute or two your Droplet should be ready. The "Resources" tab should be visible, and just below you'll see the IP address for your Droplet.
