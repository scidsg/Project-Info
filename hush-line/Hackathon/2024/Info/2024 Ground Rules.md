# 😈 Hush Line Hackathon

[Fuckyeah.Software](https://fuckyeah.software) and [CryptoHarlem](https://www.cryptoharlem.com/) present the Hush Line Hackathon, a hands-on event where we challenge you to test the security of our application, `hack.ourdemo.app`. This is a unique opportunity to engage with the security aspects of real-world applications in a controlled environment. 

## Goals

- **💣 Hack**: Break it, break-in, exfiltrate, disrupt, take over.
- **🩹 Fix**: Breaking is fun, but fixing is better. See a hole? Patch it.
- **🔨 Build**: Want to help build the app? Help close our open Issues!

## Date
TBD 2024

## Rules of Engagement

- 🎯 Target: `hack.ourdemo.app`
- 🤝 Scope: Direct all efforts at the target domain.
- ⛔️ Off-Limits: DNS, hosting providers, and any other Science & Design products and properties.

## Objectives

1. **SSH/Server Access** - _20 points_
   - Change the header logo from "🤫 Hush Line" to "🏴‍☠️ Hacked Line."
2. **Account Access** - _10 points_
   - Gain access to `deviant` or `groovy` accounts and find the codeword.
3. **Privilege Escalation** - _5 points_
   - Gain admin rights and prove it.
4. **SQL Injection** - _2 points_
   - Pull off an SQL injection and show us what you can extract.
5. **Service Disruption** - _1 point_
   - Temporarily block access to the target domain.

## How to Participate

This hackathon aims not only to foster a deeper understanding of cybersecurity among participants but also to reinforce the security of our application, ensuring it remains safe for all users. We look forward to a collaborative and constructive event.
